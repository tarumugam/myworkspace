						A quality and relaxing rural country pub, run by award winning owners, in the<br>
						beautiful Berkshire village of Peasemore just a short drive from the A34 and <br>
						junctions 13 and 14 of the M4. The building and decor are charming and rustic,<br>
						with elegant modern touches. Relax by the cozy log burner perfect for winter <br>
						evenings or enjoy outdoor seating overlooking open country fields or in a pretty<br>
						courtyard filled with flowers in the summer months. <br>
						A daily menu, all freshly prepared in the pub kitchen, includes fresh fish, pies,<br>
						steaks and chef's specials with main course prices ranging from £11.50 - £19.50.<br>
						As all dishes are prepared in the pub kitchen, they are able to cater for most <br>
						dietary needs, with most sauces, soups and gravy all created gluten free. The <br>
						Digest also offers gluten free bread and Yorkshire puddings on a Sunday.
